# Goodreads-Book-Data-Visualization
This is my capstone project about Goodreads book dataset visualization

For the capstone project, I choose a dataset which is about the books in some website about books and their reviews (GoodReads).

You can reach the dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks

We have to move the project step by step to proceed in order and properly. We have 7 steps to reach results for this part of the project. Let's look at those steps:

* Identify Problem: Identify and hypothesize goals and research questions

* Acquire Data: Import data and determine most appropriate tools for data manipulation

* Parse: Verify the quality of data and perform exploratory data analysis

* Mine: Format, clean, slice and combine data

* Refine: Apply descriptive and inferential statistics

* Build Data Viz: Create data visualisation

* Present Results: Summarize findings with narrative and storytelling techniques, present limitations, assumptions and future analysis with actionable recommendations

You can check the datasets and visualizations in .ipynb notebook
